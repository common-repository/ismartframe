== Description ==

The **iSmartFrame** plugin enhances your WordPress websiteâ€™s performance by automatically purging specific page caches whenever pages are created, updated, or deleted. This ensures your content is always fresh and your site loads faster.

**Boosted Site Performance**
Reduces loading times by purging only the updated page cache, keeping the rest of your site fast.

**Real-Time Updates**
Ensures logged-in users and comment authors always see the latest content, enhancing user experience.

**SEO Optimization**
Faster load times improve search engine rankings and visibility.

**Customizable Cache Control**
Allows you to purge specific pages, tags, or URLs, offering flexible cache management.

== Features ==

- **Automatic Cache Purge**
  Instantly clears cache when new content is published, or updates are made, ensuring only the updated page is affected.

- **Targeted Cache Management**
